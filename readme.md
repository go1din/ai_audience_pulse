## how to run the web parts

you need python, uv & zx on a "modern" unix.

Ubuntu setup has been tested, uv & zx installation instructions are [here](code/README.md#install)
OSX works, but setup procedure has not been tested

check out [readme.md](code/README.md) for proper setup instructions.

## how to run the remote esp32 cameras

see [Camera readme](code/camera/esp32s3/README.md)
## Explanation (remove eventually)

Please make sure that everything, that is code related, goes into `code` directory.

If you have documentation about the code (e.g. UML Diagrams, a readme etc.), that should go into the `documentation` directory.

If you have assets (like videos, presentations etc.), this can go into the `assets` directory.
